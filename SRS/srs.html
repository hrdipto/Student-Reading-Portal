			<h1>1. Introduction</h1>

			<div class="inside">
				<h3 id="1_1">1.1 Purpose</h3>
				<p>The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed overview of our Reading App software, the
					initial version of which is 1.0. The document will describe about the targeted audience, it’s user
					interface, hardware and software requirements. Nonetheless, it will help the designers and
					developers in the whole software delivery purpose.</p>

				<h3 id="1_2">1.2 Document Conventions</h3>
				<p>This document follows MLA Format. Bold-faced text has been used to emphasize section and sub-section
					headings. Highlighting is to point out words in the glossary and italicized text is used to label
					and recognize diagrams.</p>

				<h3 id="1_3">1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions</h3>
				<p>This document is intended towards the users, developers, designers, marketing agents, testers and
					project managers. This document will assess each audience in grasping the total concept about the
					app and its features.</p>

				<h3 id="1_4">1.4 Product Scope</h3>
				<p>This app is based on the purpose of tracking the reading of a student for a specific reading. The
					users i.e. the students can use this app in order read a given file by a teacher and his reading
					progress will be tracked by the software and this progress of each student will be then visible to
					the teacher.</p>

				<!-- The part below contains the Overall Description section of the document -->
				<div class="overall_desc" id="ovrl_desc">


					<h1>2. Overall Description</h1>

					<div class="inside">
						<!-- Section 2.1 -->

						<h3 id="2_1">2.1 Product Perspective</h3>
						<p>The product mentioned in the document will be a solution for the teacher in order to track
							his student’s progress of reading of a file provided by him. The students in general tend to
							skip the reading materials that the teachers provide which may eventually harm their
							academic results. So this app will make the students bound to read their materials as the
							teacher will be able to track their reading progress.</p>

						<!-- Section 2.2 -->

						<h3 id="2_2">2.2 Product Functions</h3>
						<p>The major functions of the product are –</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Let the teacher create a group for students to join.</li>
							<li>Let the students join a group created by a teacher via access key.
							</li>
							<li>Let the teacher assign reading materials to the students of a specific group.</li>
							<li>Reading progress of each student will be tracked.</li>
							<li>Eye will be tracked of each student while they read in order as a proof of reading.</li>
							<li>Show the teacher the reading progress of each student.</li>
						</ul>

						<!-- Section 2.3 -->

						<h3 id="2_3">2.3 User Classes and Characteristics</h3>
						<h4 class="sub_section-2.3">2.3.1 Teacher:</h4>
						<p>Teacher will mostly use this app to assign study materials to his desired number of students
							via uploading a file to a specific group containing students. And he will be able to track
							the reading progress of each student via the application.</p>

						<h4 class="sub_section-2.3">2.3.2 Student:</h4>
						<p>Students will mostly use this app to read the study material provided by the teacher of a
							specific group and then their reading progress will be tracked by the software and will be
							available for the teacher of the group to see the progress.</p>


						<h4 class="sub_section-2.3">2.3.3 Database Administrator:</h4>
						<p>The Database Administrator is expected to have a college degree and an experience of atleast
							2 years in DBA and must have a profound knowledge about IT field. They have the ability to
							update the informations in the database and manage it accordingly.</p>

						<h4 class="sub_section-2.3">2.3.4 Developer:</h4>
						<p>The developers are expected to have high knowledge about software developing and designing
							and must have a college degree along with 2 years of software developing experience and also
							a good knowledge of software related to the product scope. They have to privilege to update
							and add new features of the app for betterment of user interface.</p>

						<!-- Section 2.4 -->

						<h3 id="2_4">2.4 Operating Environment</h3>
						<p>The software will have two platforms in which it will work, one is the website platform in
							which the teacher will be able to upload files for the students to read and the other is the
							android app platform in which the student will read the reading materials. In website
							platform it will be running with the combination of JavaScript, Python and PostgreSql. And
							on the android platform it will be running with the use of Kotlin.</p>

						<!-- Section 2.5 -->

						<h3 id="2_5">2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Platform requirements:</strong> The software must work on android and on
								website.</li>
							<li><strong>Time constraint:</strong> The software must show updates in every 10 seconds.
							</li>
							<li><strong>Design constraint:</strong> The software must have eye recognition system by
								which the student’s eye can be tracked in order of a proof of reading.</li>
						</ul>

						<!-- Section 2.6 -->

						<h3 id="2_6">2.6 User Documentation</h3>
						<p>For the user documentation please refer to section 3: External Interface Requirements and
							attached user manual.</p>

						<!-- Section 2.7 -->

						<h3 id="2_7">2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
						<p>It is assumed that the software will work fine as long it is used on an android device or on
							a web browser.

							<br>

							As the software is dependent on feeding latest reading progress from the student’s android
							device through online thus the student is expected to have an internet connection while
							using the software.</p>

					</div>

				</div>


				<!-- The part below contains the External Interface Requirements section of the document -->
				<div class="external_req" id="ext_req">
					<h1>3. External Interface Requirements</h1>

					<div class="inside">
						<h3 id="3_1">3.1 User Interfaces</h3>
						<p>The user interface of Awesome Reading App has been designed in such a way so that the user doesn’t
							have to roam around to find options and get annoyed. The interface is easy to use and thus
							the user will get the hold of the software within seconds.</p>
						<p>The home screen will have the option for the user to view or create classes for the students.</p>
						<p>After selecting the view classes button and choosing the correct class then the student may read the file in that class in case of the student side and the faculty will be able to monitor his students' progress in the teahcer side.</p>


						<h3 id="3_2">3.2 Hardware Interfaces</h3>
						<p>The software will have the capability to run on computers and as well as android device. In
							computer the software will run as a website application which will be accessible with a
							browser and on the android device the software will run as android app as well as a web
							application which will be again accessible by a mobile browser.</p>


						<h3 id="3_3">3.3 Software Interfaces</h3>
						<p>The software runs on Java based android app as well as JavaScript based web app. In both
							cases the software has the ability to recognize the user eye  in terms of monitoring the students reading progress.</p>


						<h3 id="3_4">3.4 Communications Interfaces</h3>
						<p>Users need to connect the software to the main system by the means of internet. From there
							they can easily perform the reading app tasks. They
							will be able to login to the app with their registered email address and password. Whenever
							the user connects the software to the internet the software will automatically take the
							required updates. The update will completed within a very short period of time.</p>
